            <p>My full name is Gerlacus Marinus Max Messenger Bouricius (pronounced: "hahaha, good luck"), but please just call me 'Max.' I'm a programmer/musician in Boulder, Colorado, working towards an undergraduate degree in computer science and Chinese (Mandarin). My eventual goals are to build my career as a programmer/web developer/software engineer, continue to write music on the side, and then figure out what I want to in all the time in between.</p>

                <h1>A Closer Look</h1>
                <hr/>
                <h2>who i was</h2>
                <p>I was born and raised in Boulder, Colorado into a family of seven. Being both the youngest AND the only boy among 4 older sisters led to some, uh, interesting experiences. On one hand, I never had to wear hand-me-down clothing. On the other hand, only boy and 4 older sisters.</p>
                <p>Being a software engineer, my dad has always been way into computer games. Thus, it was only inevitable that I'd be playing Diablo before I was even in kindergarten. I played computer/video games from then onward, beginning to use GameMaker to make my own by the time I was 12 or so.</p>
                <p>I started getting into music in the 3rd grade, when I blew into a plastic recorder for the first time, and it all went downhill from there: band in middle school, choir in high school, and composing throughout both.</p>
                <hr/>
                <h2>who i am</h2>
                <p>Now, I'm an undergraduate student attending the University of Colorado at Boulder for a degree in computer science and Chinese (Mandarin). I currently lead a men's a cappella group here on campus called In The Buff; choosing to audition 3 years ago was perhaps the best decision I've made my entire college career.</p>
		<p>As of July 2016, I've been working as music composer for local video game development studio Serenity Forge. As of May 2017, I've worked as an undergraduate software development engineer at CU-Boulders Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, working on graphical unit testing for Lockheed Martin's infrared missile detection satellite systems. </p>
                <p>Given how fortunate I've been these last few years, it's honestly hard to imagine a better situation to be in as a student -- attending a wonderful school, working towards a career I love, pursuing my creative passions on the side, and all the while being surrounded by the support of friends and family.</p>
                <hr/>
                <h2>who i want to be</h2>
                <p>My immediate goals at the moment are to graduate, continue my career in a programming-related field, and pay off my loans. Beyond that, my goals are deliberately vague: make a comfortable living, continue to write and perform music, take up new hobbies, strengthen connections with those I love, and live a positive/healthy life. However and wherever this ends up happening, I'll embrace it with open arms and an open mind.</p>

                <h1>Photography</h1>
                <p>I like to take photos! Some of them turn out okay. In fact, every background/banner image on this website was taken by me over the course of several years. Some day I'll be able to afford an actual DSLR, but until then I guess my humble, oh-so-budget smartphone will have to do. Check out some of my favorite shots below, or find higher-res versions <a href="//imgur.com/a/Cvif4">here</a>.</p>
